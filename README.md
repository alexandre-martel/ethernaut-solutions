# Ethernaut Writeups

Welcome to this repository containing my writeups for the challenges of the **Ethernaut** game, created by OpenZeppelin.  
Ethernaut is a CTF based on the Ethereum blockchain, where each level represents a vulnerability or an important security concept in Solidity smart contracts.

## 📌 Objective
The goal of this repo is to document solutions to Ethernaut levels with a detailed explanation of the exploited vulnerabilities and the underlying concepts.  

These writeups can be useful for:
- Understanding smart contract security principles  
- Learning how to identify and exploit vulnerabilities  
- Improving skills in Solidity and blockchain security  

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each challenge level is documented in a dedicated file with the following format:
writeups/ ├── Level_X_Name.md # Writeup for level X ├── Level_Y_Name.md # Writeup for level Y ...

Each writeup includes:
- A **level overview** (goal and smart contract code)
- An **explanation of the exploited vulnerabilities**
- An **attack strategy**
- The **exploit code** in Solidity or JavaScript (Ethers.js or Web3.js)
- A **conclusion and best practices** to avoid such vulnerabilities

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
To reproduce the exploits or test the solutions, you will need:
- **Remix IDE** → [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
- **Hardhat** → [https://hardhat.org/](https://hardhat.org/)
- **Ethers.js** to interact with the blockchain
- **MetaMask** to sign transactions
